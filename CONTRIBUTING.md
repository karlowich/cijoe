# Contributing

We're glad you want to contribute! This document will help answer common
questions you may have during your first contribution.

## Contribution Process

We have a 3 step process for contributions:

1. Commit changes to a git branch, making sure to sign-off those changes for the
   [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certification-of-origin-dco).
2. Create a GitHub Pull Request for your change, following the instructions in
   the pull request template.
3. Perform a [Code Review](#code-review-process) with the project maintainers on
   the pull request.

### Developer Certification of Origin (DCO)

Licensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the
software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.

CIJOE uses the Apache 2.0 LICENSE to strike a balance between open contribution
and allowing you to use the software however you would like to.

The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright
holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights they
are licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the
contributor, such as when the contributor is doing work on behalf of a company.

To make a good faith effort to ensure these criteria are met, CIJOE requires
the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process to be followed.

The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every
developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds
a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find
below or at <http://developercertificate.org/>.

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to   
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

#### DCO Sign-Off Methods

The DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each
commit in the pull request:

```
Signed-off-by: Simon A. F. Lund <simon.lund@samsung.com>
```

The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add
either **-s** or **--signoff** to your usual git commit commands. If you forget
to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by
running **git commit --amend -s**. If you've pushed your changes to GitHub
already you'll need to force push your branch after this with **git push -f**.
